# Implicit Flow

::: warning
The [OAuth 2.0 BCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-09#section-2.1.2) states that you **should not** use the Implicit Flow to request [Access Tokens](/tokens/access-tokens) from the Authorization Server. For this reason, we recommend that you use the [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce) if your single-page app (SPA) requires Access Tokens for [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/cross-origin-authentication#what-is-cross-origin-authentication) requests.
:::

During authentication, single-page applications (SPAs) have some special requirements. Since the SPA is a public client, it is unable to securely store information such as a Client Secret. As such, traditional guidance suggests using a special authentication flow exists called the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow (defined in [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2)). 

Using the Implicit Flow streamlines authentication by returning tokens without introducing any unnecessary additional steps, but often returns tokens in the URL. As such, new guidance recommends the [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce) instead. For a more detailed explanation, see our blog post [OAuth2 Implicit Grant and SPA: Everything you always wanted to know (but were afraid to ask)](https://auth0.com/blog/oauth2-implicit-grant-and-spa/).

## How it works

In the Implicit Flow, issued tokens are short-lived. <dfn data-key="refresh-token">Refresh Tokens</dfn> are not available in this flow.

1. The user clicks **Login** in the app.
2. Auth0's SDK redirects the user to the Auth0 Authorization Server (**/authorize** endpoint) passing along a `response_type` parameter that indicates the type of requested credential.
3. Your Auth0 Authorization Server redirects the user to the login and authorization prompt.
4. The user authenticates using one of the configured login options and may see a consent page listing the permissions Auth0 will give to the app.
5. Your Auth0 Authorization Server redirects the user back to the app with any of the following, depending on the provided `response_type` parameter (step 2):
* An ID Token;
* An Access Token;
* An ID Token and an Access Token.
6. Your app can use the Access Token to call an API.
7. The API responds with requested data.

## How to implement it

You can use our [Javascript SDKs](/libraries). Please ensure you are implementing mitigations that are appropriate for your architecture.

::: note
The Auth0 Single-Page App SDK and Single-Page Quickstarts adhere to the new recommendations and use the [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce).

Finally, you can follow our tutorials to use our API endpoints toÂ [Add Login Using the Implicit Flow](/flows/guides/implicit/add-login-implicit).
