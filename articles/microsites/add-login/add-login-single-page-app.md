Using Auth0 in your applications means that you will be "outsourcing" the authentication process to a centralized login page in the same way that Gmail, YouTube, and any other Google property redirects to accounts.google.com whenever a user signs in.

Your user will authenticate, and Auth0 will generate an ID Token that will be passed back to your application.

## How it works

For security in SPAs, depending on your architecture, you may choose to use either the [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce) or the [Implicit Flow](/flows/concepts/implicit). For a more detailed explanation, see our blog post: [OAuth2 Implicit Grant and SPA: Everything you always wanted to know (but were afraid to ask)](https://auth0.com/blog/oauth2-implicit-grant-and-spa/).

### Authorization Code Flow with PKCE

In a single-page application (SPA): 

1. The user clicks your "login" button or link, and our SDK redirects the user to your Auth0 Authorization Server.
2. The user authenticates with Auth0 using one of your configured login options (e.g., username/password, social identity provider, <dfn data-key="security-assertion-markup-language">SAML</dfn>).
3. Your app requests the user's ID Token.
4. Auth0 responds with the user's ID Token.

### Implicit Flow

In a single-page application (SPA): 

1. The user clicks your "login" button or link, and our SDK redirects the user to your Auth0 Authorization Server requesting an ID Token.
2. The user authenticates with Auth0 using one of your configured login options (e.g., username/password, social identity provider, <dfn data-key="security-assertion-markup-language">SAML</dfn>).
3. Auth0 responds with the user's ID Token.

## Implementation overview

::: steps
  1. <h4>Configure the sign-in methods</h4>Auth0 supports a wide range of authentication methods: regular username/password (users can be stored in Auth0 or your own database), social (i.e., Google, Facebook, and 50+ other providers), <dfn data-key="passwordless">passwordless</dfn> (email magic link, email code, and phone code), and enterprise (e.g., SAML-based, ADFS, Ping, Okta).<br/><br/>Go to the dashboard and turn on the methods you want to allow; they will automatically show up in the login/sign-up page. By default, email/password and Google are enabled.

  2. <h4>Customize the sign-in UI (optional)</h4>The default experience is demonstrated in the image below and can be completely customized in the dashboard, from changing the logo and primary colors to completely overriding it with your own login screen.<br/><br/><img src="/media/articles/microsites/login-screen-default-web.png" alt="Default Login Screen for Native/Mobile Apps" width="70%">

  3. <h4>Use the Auth0 SDK to trigger the flow</h4>The SDK will take care of the details of redirecting to Auth0, parsing the response back, and validating the ID Token.<br/><br/>Your app can keep the ID Token in memory.

The easiest way to implement the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is to [follow our Single-Page App Quickstarts](/quickstart/spa). You can also use our [Auth0 Single-Page App SDK](/libraries/auth0-spa-js).

To securely implement the Implicit Flow, you can use the [Express OpenID Connect SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-openid-connect). If you use our [Javascript SDK](/libraries/auth0js), please ensure you are implementing mitigations that are appropriate for your architecture.

Finally, to use our API endpoints, you can follow one of our tutorials: [Add Login Using the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/flows/guides/auth-code-pkce/add-login-auth-code-pkce) or [Add Login Using the Implicit Flow](/flows/guides/implicit/add-login-implicit).

  * Auth0 offers many ways to personalize your user's login experience and customize tokens using [rules](/rules) and [hooks](/hooks).
  * Many single-page apps access APIs to retrieve data, which can also be done using Auth0. Learn how to call your API from your app: [Call Your API from Your Single-Page App](/microsites/call-api/call-api-single-page-app).
